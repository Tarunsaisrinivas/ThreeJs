# Digantara Three.js Assignment - Object Highlighter Using Stencil Buffer

## 🔍 Objective

## 🧱 Features

- Interactive 3D scene with OrbitControls
- Ground plane and 5 unique 3D objects (box, sphere, cone, torus, cylinder)
- Object picking with raycasting
- Highlighting the selected object using a visual cue (stencil buffer technique can be extended here)
